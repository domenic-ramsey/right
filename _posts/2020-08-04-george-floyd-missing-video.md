Dangerous and unbelievably high - that's how one can describe George Floyd's behavior just before the officer pins him to the ground.

You can see the suspect fully disoriented, not following orders, and being uncooperative. He keeps repeating "I can't breathe" - probably due to the drugs-induced paranoia - while officers are patiently trying to get him to sit in the car.

Finally, he just pushes the officer out of the car with his own body - and that's how Floyd ended up on the ground. Not being "dragged out." Then he keeps repeating the same "I can't breathe" mantra that he was said a dozen of times already. Officers don't pay much attention, treating him as a drugged, dangerous, and uncooperative subject - and for a good reason.

There's only one question: why this video surfaces two months after the riots and after Floyd has been already made into a martyr?
