Have you ever thought about what the moral foundation of the liberal/leftist ideology is? Any ideology needs one, right?

This question bothered me for quite some time, and now I think I finally figured it out! I know what's at the center of the leftist movement.

## How leftists think

This has nothing to do with "libertas" (freedom), and everything to do with how a specific individual (randomly) perceives what is moral, at this precise moment. Having captured this perception (or rather, a "feeling"), the individual (let's call him "Jim") starts to judge everything and every one based on how they "feel." No matter where or when events happened - Jim knows for sure what was right and what was wrong!

Very conveniently, this knowledge happens to coincide with Jim's personal morals. The morals are so pure and universal that they cross space and time, so Jim can reliably measure events that happened 50 (or 200) years ago by these same standards.

Unfortunately, a mere act of judging is not enough for Jim. Because he holds the one and only truth, he feels a burning need and desire to "educate" everyone. To bring ignorants from the darkness that they have been lurking in - into the light! Jim understands that you're lucky because you met such an enlightened individual (Jim).

While trying to "educate" you, Jim is all roses and smiles and hearts. He sees how badly misguided you are, **but only if you've known what he knows** - you would've instantly agreed with Jim! Because Jim desperately needs you to agree with him.

But when such "educating" fails, and you keep holding your ground, pointing to weak spots in Jim's arguments, Jim becomes offended. Not only that, but Jim also becomes violent. He's deeply hurt by your "ignorance": "*I explained everything, you must be a moron if you still don't understand!*"

Jim feels that you have to be forced somehow, that you still have to agree with him. So he makes it his mission to make your life miserable: to make sure your friends and bosses know that you're such a "racist." How you don't understand the fundamental social issues, and how you must be educated (so you finally submit and agree on every point with Jim) - or else!

## What Jim wants?

This is how Jim thinks, and that's what he wants. He wants the whole world to accept and confirm the exact beliefs that Jim holds at this moment. Without that, no real happiness is possible for Jim. So Jim is on an endless crusade to educate everyone - and to "cancel." He doesn't create anything meaningful, **he just wants the world to "be" the way he thinks is right**.
