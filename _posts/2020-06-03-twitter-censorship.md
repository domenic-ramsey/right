Twitter is allowing tag spamming and manipulation, even though it goes against [its own policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation). Apparently, it only happens with tags that do not fit the liberal agenda.

Imagine a police officer who sees [\#bluelivesmatter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueLivesMatter) trending, only to realize that it's been spammed by K-Pop bands and Sonic the Hedgehog?

As the time of writing, Twitter only allows pro-leftists tags to "trend."
