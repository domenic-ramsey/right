Officer Myrick was fired for a Facebook post where he discussed how a real "privilege" might look like, citing some examples. Why? Because his narrative - which was passionately, but carefully delivered - wasn't in line with the leftist agenda. Here's the officer's original post:


*Privilege is wearing $200 sneakers when you've never had a job.*

*Privilege is wearing $300 Beats headphones while living on public assistance.*

*Privilege is having a Smartphone with a Data plan which you receive no bill for.*

*Privilege is living in public subsidized housing where you don't have a water bill, where rising property taxes and rents and energy costs have absolutely no effect on the amount of food you can put on your table.*

*Privilege is the ability to go march against, and protest against anything that triggers you, without worrying about calling out of work and the consequences that accompany such behavior.*

*Privilege is having as many children as you want, regardless of your employment status, and be able to send them off to daycare or school you don't pay for.*

*Privilege is sending your kids to school early for the before school programs and breakfast, and then keeping them there for the after school program...all at no cost to you...paid for by the people who DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH RISING TAXES AND COSTS!... you know, us so called 'PRIVILEGED' the ones who pay while you TAKE TAKE TAKE!*
