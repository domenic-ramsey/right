## Data Disclaimer

We only use data from US Government agencies and trusted private organizations.

For this research, we used 2018 data because 2019 data was still not available at the time of writing.

### Shot to death by police

Shot to death by police in 2018[^1]:
- 454 white
- 229 black

US population of age 12 and older in 2018[^2]:
- Total: 278,774,433
- 62.3% white (173,594,531)
- 12.3% black (34,237,037)

Shot to death by police per 1 million in 2018:
- White: 2.615
- Black: 6.689

It's <mark>2.56 times more likely</mark> to get killed by police if black and not white in 2018.

### Violent crimes

- White: 2,669,900
- Black: 1,155,670

The number of violent offenders per 1 million in 2018:
- White: 15,380
- Black: 33,755

## Conclusion

- Per capita, blacks commit violent crimes 2.20 times more often than whites
- Per capita, blacks got shot to death by police 2.56 times more often than whites

There's a difference of 0.36 (or 14%) between these rates, which is within a margin of error.
