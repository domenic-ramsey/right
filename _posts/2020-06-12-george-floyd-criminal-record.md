## Aggravated Robbery Details

*As Complainant Henriquez looked out the front window, she observed a black male dressed in a blue uniform who told her that he was with the water department. As Complainant Henriquez opened the door, she immediately realized that this person was not with the water department and attempted to close the door. However, this male held the door open and prevented her from doing so.*

*At this time, a black Ford Explorer pulled up in front of the Complainants' residence and five other black males exited this vehicle and proceeded to the front door. <mark>The largest of these suspects forced his way into the residence, placed a pistol against the [pregnant] complainant's abdomen, and forced her into the living room area of the residence.</mark> This large suspect then proceeded to search the residence while another armed suspect guarded the complainant, who was struck in the head and side areas by this second armed suspect with his pistol after she screamed for help. As the suspects looked through the residence, they demanded to know where the drugs and money were and Complainant Henriquez advised them that there were no such things in the residence. The suspects then took some jewelry along with the complainant's cell phone before they fled the scene in the black Ford Explorer, whose license plate was written down by a neighbor*
   
*[..] Complainants Henriquez and Negrete and Complainant Henriquez tentatively <mark>identified Defendant George Floyd as being the largest of the suspects who initially forced his way into her home, pulled the pistol into her abdominal area, and forced her into the living room area.</mark>*
