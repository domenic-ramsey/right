Now we [finally know](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293280411150217219) who Biden has chosen as a running mate. A lady who isn't [exactly black](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/opinions/black-women-biden-vice-president-jones/index.html), but seems close enough.

Unfortunately, I think this choice is not nearly as woke as many leftists hoped. In the hierarchy of oppression and victimhood, Kamala Harris is in the middle, not even close the top!

Couldn't Biden instead find an **overweight disabled uneducated black Mexican Muslim transgender non-binary gender-fluid woman who is an orphaned drug-addicted illegal immigrant, has AIDS, COVID, a mental illness, and was a victim of gang rape and child abuse**? He didn't do his homework - there are many such women, and each of them would've been a great running mate!

In all seriousness, one can't reasonably expect Biden to remain even remotely of a sound mind for the next year, let alone four years. If Democrats' secret plan is to declare Biden incapacitated and have a vice-president to take over, that would be a textbook definition of "treason."
